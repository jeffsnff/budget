# budget


This is my final  project for V School which I developed in November 2019. I have continued to work on it on the front and backend rebuilding portions to be more mobile friendly, as well a more UI/UI friendly. 

This project allows a user to track their accounts and expenses like a digital checkbook as well as view their balance.
